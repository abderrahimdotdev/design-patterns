         * The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables a
         * client to choose an algorithm from a family of algorithms at runtime. It
         * allows you to define a set of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them
         * interchangeable. This pattern is useful when you need to vary an algorithm or
         * behavior in an object without altering the object's code.
